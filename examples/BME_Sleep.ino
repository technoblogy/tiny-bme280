  Tiny BME280 Library
  https://github.com/technoblogy/tiny-bme280
  Example to print out environmental data (temperature, pressure, humidity) once every two seconds.
  Sleeps in-between reading for lower power consumption.

  Connections:
  BME --- MCU
  VCC to 3v3
  GND to GND
  SDA to A4
  SCL to A5

  Set your Serial monitor to 9600 baud and click the magnifiying glass icon on the top-right.
